# Pivot

Pivot is a web-based exploratory visualization UI for [Druid](https://github.com/druid-io/druid) built on top of 
[Plywood](https://github.com/implydata/plywood). 

Pivot is best used with the [Imply Analytics Platform](http://imply.io/product)
which can be downloaded from [imply.io/download](http://imply.io/download) and comes with the stable version of Pivot.
Alternatively nightly standalone Pivot versions can be installed through npm. 

The project is currently undergoing rapid development.
Internal and external APIs may change with little notice.

## Usage

### Ensure that you have an up-to-date node

Make sure you have node (>= 4.x.x) installed. On MacOS with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) you can do:

```
brew update
brew install node
```

### Install

Next simply run:

```
npm i -g imply-pivot
```

**That's it.** You are ready to Pivot.


### Example

Start off by running an example (static) dataset:

```
pivot --example wiki
```

### Run with Druid

Next connect Pivot to your broker by simply pointing it to your broker host

```
pivot --druid your.druid.broker.host:8082
```

Pivot will automatically introspect your Druid cluster and figure out your dimensions and measures.

**Note:** if Pivot starts up and gives you a query error it is most likely because it could not properly introspect your schema.
You probably have some *hyperUnique* column that Pivot is trying to SUM over.
You will have to provide Pivot with a config file as in the nest section.   

### Create a config

In general Pivot will never know your schema as well as you.
To get a better experience you should create a config and provide it to Pivot.
The fastest way to create a config is to have Pivot do it for you.

```
pivot --druid your.druid.broker.host:8082 --print-config --with-comments > config.yaml
```

The `--print-config` option will make Pivot run through its regular introspection and then, instead of spinning up a server, dump the YAML onto the stdout and exit.  

```
pivot --config config.yaml
```

The next step is to examine and tweak the config using your favorite editor `nano config.yaml`.

## Development

Here are the steps to clone Pivot and run it as a developer. 

Firstly make sure you have the latest node (>= 5.5.x) and gulp installed:

```
npm i -g gulp
```

Clone the project

```
git clone git@github.com:implydata/pivot.git
cd pivot
```

Inside the pivot folder run:

```
npm install
gulp
```

Finally you have to create a `config.yaml` file. (or use the sample)

```
./bin/pivot --druid your.druid.broker.host:8082 --print-config --with-comments > config.yaml
```

The `--with-comments` flag adds docs about what goes into the config.
Alternatively you can read the comments in the [sample config file](/config.yaml.sample).

Then you are ready to

```
./bin/pivot --config config.yaml
```

We use [WebStorm 2016.1](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) to develop Pivot and the checked in `.idea` directory contains
all of the auto formatting and code styles. You are free to use any editor as all the build scripts are editor agnostic.

Running `gulp watch` will build the project and start all the automated watchers.
